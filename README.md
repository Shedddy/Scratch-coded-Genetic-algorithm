# IMPLEMENTATION OF GENETIC ALGORITHMS(GA) FOR ENHANCED MODEL PERFORMANCE AND OPTIMAL RESULTS

The aim of this Project was to :
1. Code a genetic algorithm from scratch.
2. Implement the coded GA in tuning and optimizing the hyperparameters of Machine Learning Models.
3. Apply the coded GA in finding the optimal combination of the input features that would yield the optimal target.
